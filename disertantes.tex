\subsubsection{Short biography}

Rajesh Menon has pioneered several technologies that will enable far-field optics to manipulate and image matter with nanoscale resolution, something that was thought impossible until a few years ago. His research has spawned over 50 publications, over 30 patents, and 2 spin-off companies. He has led several projects in nanopatterning and nanoscopy with support from DARPA, the NSF, US Air Force, and the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation. Among his honors are an NSF CAREER Award (2011) and the International Commission for Optics Prize (2009).\\
He currently directs the Laboratory for Optical Nanotechnologies at the University of Utah. Prior to that, Prof. Menon was a research engineer at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics, where he remains a research affiliate. He holds S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. In addition, he served as the Chief Technology Officer of LumArray, a company he co-founded with colleagues at MIT. \\

\subsubsection{Research fields}
\begin{itemize}
\item Absorbance Modulation Optical Lithography (AMOL) 
\item Patterning via Optical Saturable Transformations (POST) 
\item Ultra-high efficiency photovoltaics via Diffractive Spectrum Separation 
\item Optimized Nanophotonics for efficient ultra-thin-film photovoltaics 
\item 3D tracking of surgical instruments 
\end{itemize}
