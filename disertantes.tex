\subsubsection{Short biography}

Rajesh Menon has pioneered several technologies that will enable far-field optics to manipulate and image matter with nanoscale resolution, something that was thought impossible until a few years ago. His research has spawned over 50 publications, over 30 patents, and 2 spin-off companies. He has led several projects in nanopatterning and nanoscopy with support from DARPA, the NSF, US Air Force, and the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation. Among his honors are an NSF CAREER Award (2011) and the International Commission for Optics Prize (2009).\\
He currently directs the Laboratory for Optical Nanotechnologies at the University of Utah. Prior to that, Prof. Menon was a research engineer at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics, where he remains a research affiliate. He holds S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. In addition, he served as the Chief Technology Officer of LumArray, a company he co-founded with colleagues at MIT. \\

\subsubsection{Presentation: Circumventing the far-field diffraction limit in optical nanopatterning and imaging}

A technique for creating deterministic structural complexity is essential to achieve high functionality at the
nanoscale, whether in electronics, photonics, or molecular biology. Scanning-electron-beam lithography (SEBL) is
the most widely used method in research, but it has a number of drawbacks. SEBL tends to be slow, expensive,
prone to placement errors, and not compatible with organics and biological material. Ideally one would prefer to
employ benign photons in the visible or near IR range for such patterning. However, the so-called far-field
diffraction barrier (first realized by Abbé) limits the smallest feature achievable by wavelength, $\lambda$ to $\sim \lambda / 4$. The
spacing between nearest-neighbor patterns cannot be smaller than $\sim \lambda / 4$.
In this presentation, I will review the approaches for nanoscale imaging in fluorescence microscopy.
Furthermore, I will describe two distinct approaches being investigated in my laboratory to circumvent the far-field
diffraction limit and thereby enable optical nanopatterning with feature spacings smaller than $\lambda / 4$.
